# 0xinfra

**0xinfra** is a curated and stable repository for offensive infrastructure development and reverse engineering — maintained by a security researcher with 4+ years of experience.

The toolkit includes:
- 🛠️ Cross-compilers for multi-architecture binary builds  
- 🕷️ Botnet sources (public + patched) for analysis and testing  
- ⚙️ Automation scripts for loaders, DDoS builders, deployment  
- 🧩 Personal utilities and internal-use helpers  
- 📚 Straightforward docs & guides — no clutter

Everything in this repository is intended **strictly for educational and ethical security research purposes**.

There are **no precompiled binaries**, no malware payloads — only source code, infrastructure tooling, and scripts for controlled environments.
